## [Unreleased]

v1.3.1 P(-1) audit/review. Slices 1-4 (committed): toolchain bump, cstring/Str linter, buffer-safety sweep, syscall-return audit + chmod fixes + audit report. Slice 5 (this cut): **doc audit + ADR-006**. Captures the v1.2.0/v1.3.0 bug-class learnings as an architectural decision record; refines ADR-005's per-module convention with the three operational rules (explicit `_in_str` suffix, per-arch syscall wrappers, `str_clone` for static-buf escape) and references the 14-pattern CI lint shield as the mechanical enforcement.

### Slice 5 — doc audit + ADR-006 (this cut)

#### Added
- **docs/adr/006-cstr-str-dispatch-discipline.md** — refines ADR-005 with the operational rules earned by v1.2.0/v1.3.0 production discovery. Catalogues the seven distinct bug variants (each linked back to its discovery slice), codifies the `_in_str` suffix convention (and the load-bearing rename from `is_safe_path_str` to `safe_path_in_str` to sidestep Cyrius's overload-registration trap), and documents the four rules: (1) explicit `_str`-side suffix at cross-type boundaries, (2) per-arch syscall wrappers, (3) `str_clone` for static-buf escape, (4) CI lint shield as the mechanical enforcement. Includes the four alternatives considered (stay-with-005, --strict-types in Cyrius, all-Str, Cyrius lint plugin) with rejection rationale.
- **docs/adr/README.md** — index entry for ADR-006 + the "Writing a new ADR" footer bumped (current: 006, next: 007).

#### Changed
- **docs/doc-health.md** — Tier 4 (ADRs) and Tier 5 (Audit reports) rows refreshed. ADR-005 status now reads "Refined by ADR-006" (still frozen, but its discipline-table is now augmented by 006's operational rules). Audit report `2026-05-11-pminus1.md` row added with the running-tally severity counts. ADR-posture commentary updated to reflect that v1.1.0 was a modernization (no ADR), v1.2.0 was a feature pass with no architectural reversal (no ADR), and v1.3.0's repeated bug-class discovery earned ADR-006.

#### Notes
- **Doc deliverables for v1.3.1 P(-1) are complete.** The roadmap's `Doc audit — doc-health.md refresh, ADRs for any architectural calls` line is satisfied (ADR landed; doc-health Tier rows refreshed). What remains in the v1.3.1 P(-1) roadmap: input validation sweep, no-command-injection audit (deferred to v1.4.0 exec wire-up — agnoshi has no exec call sites in the live binary yet), no-path-traversal sweep (largely covered by `safe_path_in_str` + the linter), and known-CVE review. These are smaller residual items; v1.3.1 can close after one or two more bites.

### Slice 4 — syscall return-value handling (committed)

#### Fixed
- **history.cyr:112 — `sys_chmod` return unchecked** on `$HOME/.agnsh_history`. **HIGH severity**: if chmod fails (race / NFS / unusual filesystem), the history file stays at the umask default (typically 0644), leaking every shell command the user has ever typed to other users on a multi-user system. **Live in agnsh** (saved on every `exit` / `quit`). Captured the return; writes a one-line stderr warning on non-zero result so the operator sees a visible signal without escalating the write failure (the file itself was already written successfully).
- **checkpoint.cyr:29 — `sys_chmod` return unchecked** on `$HOME/.agnoshi/checkpoints/`. **HIGH severity**: directory holds pre-destructive-op backups; same multi-user data-leak shape. Same fix applied. Deferred module today; ready for v1.4.0 exec wire-up.

#### Added
- **scripts/lint-cstr-str.sh — Category E: unchecked sys_chmod**. Pattern `^\s*sys_chmod\(` flags any chmod statement where the result isn't captured into a variable or an `if` condition. Catches bare `sys_chmod(path, mode);` but allows `var rc = sys_chmod(...)` and `if (sys_chmod(...) != 0)`. Closes the security-critical syscall-return-handling class.
- **docs/audit/2026-05-11-pminus1.md** — consolidated P(-1) audit report covering all four slices so far (toolchain bump, cstring/Str linter, buffer-safety sweep, syscall return audit). Records every finding by severity, the fix applied, and the forward-shield (lint pattern) added. Per AGNOS first-party-standards convention.

#### Notes
- **Syscall site catalog** in the audit report: 35+ sites categorized. 19 sites verified clean (return-checked or "never fails" syscalls like getuid). 8 stdout/stderr writes intentionally ignored (LOW severity — terminal/pipe failures rare; conventional). 2 sys_chmod fixed (HIGH). 3 SYS_GETCWD return-unchecked sites in `session.cyr` flagged as MEDIUM and deferred to the v1.4.0 wire-up slice (the fix involves a fallback-path policy decision: display "?" / use last-known cwd / fail-loudly).
- **Chmod-failure probe**: deliberately tried to trigger chmod failure (`chmod 000` on the history file then re-running agnsh) didn't fire — Linux grants chmod on user-owned files regardless of current mode. The code path is correct; symptoms would surface on NFS / SELinux denials / AppArmor / read-only FS. The linter prevents future regressions.
- **Cumulative shield count**: 14 lint patterns across 5 categories. **All 7 distinct bug variants** that surfaced over v1.2.0/v1.3.0 (cstring/Str type mismatches, semantic drift, aarch64 syscalls, static-buf escape, unchecked chmod) are now CI-caught at lint time. The 8th audit class (sys_write return) is NOT linted; logging best-effort is the consensus default.

### Slice 3 — buffer-safety sweep + static-buf-escape linter (committed)

#### Fixed
Five sites in deferred modules carried the static-buffer-escape pattern — `str_from(&buf)` wrapping a `var buf[N]` static buffer, with the resulting Str either *returned* or *stored in a long-lived struct*. Each call to the same fn would overwrite the buffer and silently invalidate every earlier returned Str. The fix is `str_clone(str_from(&buf))` to deep-copy into a heap buffer the Str owns. Same pattern that bit `CommandHistory_add` in slice 7 of v1.3.0 (every history entry's data aliased to whatever was last typed).
- **ui.cyr:13** — `read_input_line` returned `str_from(&buf)` where `buf` was the function-local 4 KB stdin buffer. Every caller would see the same Str data after the next `read_input_line` call.
- **prompt.cyr:18** — `PromptContext_new` stored `str_from(&hostname_buf + 65)` (uname's nodename field) into the prompt context struct. Long-lived store, function-local buffer.
- **session.cyr:22, 162, 256** — three `str_from(&cwd_buf)` sites storing the cwd into the prompt context / session struct after a `chdir`. Same shape.

All five wrapped with `str_clone`. The modules stay deferred to v1.4.0's exec wire-up; the fix means that wire-up doesn't double as a bug-discovery slice.

#### Added
- **scripts/lint-cstr-str.sh — Category D: static-buffer escape**. Two new patterns:
  - `return str_from(&...)` — Str borrowing a local static buf, returned to outlive the buf.
  - `store64(*, str_from(&...))` — Str borrowing a local static buf, stored into a long-lived struct slot.
  
  Together they catch the aliasing-trap class that took slice 7 of v1.3.0 to discover (and three more slices of confusion before that to even see). Escape hatch (`# lint:cstr-ok`) still applies for any rare intentional case (single-call, immediate-use lifetimes).

- **Documentation in the linter** of the five distinct bug variants the script now retroactively catches:
  - `str_len(cstring)` — slice 1 v1.2.0
  - `str_sub(start, end)` semantics — slice 1 v1.2.0 (semantic, not type; covered by str_substr migration)
  - `str_cat(cstring, *)` — slice 7 v1.2.0 + slice 8 v1.3.0
  - `str_cat(*, cstring)` — slice 2 v1.3.1
  - `is_safe_path(Str)` — slice 3 v1.3.0 (silent translate_unknown for every NL filesystem op since v1.0)
  - aarch64 raw syscalls — v1.3.0 closeout
  - `str_from(&static_buf)` aliasing — slice 7 v1.3.0

#### Notes
- **Buffer size audit** — every `var buf[N]` in agnoshi's source catalogued and verified safe:
  - `agnsh.cyr:230 var b[1]` (1 i64 = 8B; reads 1 byte at a time)
  - `agnsh.cyr:273 var buf[4096]` (4096 i64s = 32 KB; reads up to 4096 bytes)
  - `interpreter.cyr:528 var cmd_out[1]` (8B; cstring ptr)
  - `approval.cyr:85 var buf[64]` (512B; reads up to 63 bytes)
  - `security.cyr:86 var stat_buf[18]` (144B = exact `struct stat` size on x86_64)
  - Plus 7 more in deferred modules (ui/prompt/session); all within size limits, all escape-paths now str_cloned.
  
  Verified that Cyrius's `var buf[N]` allocates `N` i64 *words* (8N bytes), not N raw bytes — confirmed against `lib/process.cyr`'s `var status_buf[1]` for waitpid (kernel writes 4 bytes; [1] = 8 bytes available, safe). The CI security-scan's `"%d bytes"` warn message under-counts by 8× but the 8 KB / 64 KB thresholds still bracket the actual hard limits sensibly.
- **No live-binary impact** — all 5 escape-pattern fixes are in modules not currently linked into `agnsh`. Binary size unchanged at 293,792 B (x86) / 337,032 B (aarch64). Tests stay at 301/301; smoke at 58/58.

### Slice 2 — cstring/Str type-mismatch linter (committed)

#### Fixed
The linter caught two real bugs on its first run, both in modules deferred to v1.4.0 wire-up but reachable through future test_core inclusion:
- **session.cyr:101** — `str_starts_with(trimmed, "mode ")`. `str_starts_with` is Str-typed in both args and has NO `_cstr` overload (verified in `lib/str.cyr` — there's `str_starts_with` Str+Str only). Pre-fix this would have made the interactive-session mode-switch builtin silently never match. Wrapped the cstring with `str_from`.
- **checkpoint.cyr:22** — `syscall(SYS_CHMOD, ...)` — same aarch64-broken pattern as the audit/history/security fixes from v1.3.0 closeout. SYS_CHMOD doesn't exist in aarch64's generic syscall table (only `fchmodat`). Switched to the `sys_chmod` wrapper from `lib/io.cyr`.

A third hit at `main.cyr:32` (`syscall(SYS_OPEN, ...)`) was marked with the `# lint:cstr-ok` escape hatch — `src/main.cyr` is the v1.0 pre-port entry, never linked into any binary's include graph.

#### Added
- **scripts/lint-cstr-str.sh** — static analyzer for the Cyrius cstring/Str mismatch class. Greps for known-bad patterns in 8 categories:
  - First-arg cstring literals: `str_len("...")`, `str_data("...")`, `str_cat("...", *)`, `str_starts_with("...", *)`, `str_ends_with("...", *)`
  - Second-arg cstring literals: `str_cat(*, "...")`, `str_starts_with(*, "...")`, `str_ends_with(*, "...")`
  - Cross-arch-broken raw syscalls: `syscall(SYS_OPEN, ...)`, `syscall(SYS_CHMOD, ...)`, `syscall(SYS_STAT, ...)`
  
  Coverage rationale documented inline: only flags fns that DON'T have a `_cstr` overload variant in `lib/str.cyr` (so `str_contains` / `str_eq` / `str_split` are intentionally not flagged — Cyrius's name-mangling dispatch routes them to the `_cstr` form automatically). The five distinct runtime bugs the linter retroactively catches: `str_len(cstring)` from v1.2.0 slice 1, `str_cat(cstring, *)` from slice 7 of v1.2.0 + slice 8 of v1.3.0, `str_cat(*, cstring)` from slice 2 of v1.3.0, `is_safe_path(Str)` from slice 3 of v1.3.0 (silent translate_unknown for every NL filesystem op since v1.0), and the v1.3.0 closeout's aarch64 syscall break. Each was discovered the hard way (probe / SIGSEGV / first-use crash) — the linter catches them at lint time.
- **CI wire-up** — `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs `scripts/lint-cstr-str.sh` after the coverage gate. Below-clean state now fails CI like fmt / lint / capacity drift.
- **Escape hatch** — trailing `# lint:cstr-ok` comment on a specific line marks an intentional use (used once: `src/main.cyr:32` for the legacy pre-port entry).

### Slice 1 — Cyrius toolchain bump 5.10.34 → 5.10.44 (committed)

#### Changed
- **Cyrius toolchain pin 5.10.34 → 5.10.44** (`cyrius.cyml`). 10-patch bump along the 5.10 line, no major / minor changes. `cyrius deps` repopulated `./lib/` from the 5.10.44 snapshot. All gates clean on the bumped pin: check, capacity, fmt, lint, test_core 301/301, test_security 26/26, smoke 58/58, coverage 86%, both arches build (x86_64 293,792 B / aarch64 337,032 B).

#### Performance
- Bracketed benchmarks before+after the pin bump (recorded in `bench-history.csv`). All 10 benchmark averages unchanged to the microsecond resolution — parse path stays in the 3-13us band, translate stays at 1us, sanitize stays at 1us. Codegen drift on x86_64 was −32 bytes (293,824 → 293,792 B); aarch64 binary size unchanged at 337,032 B. No regression, no measurable performance change in either direction.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-05-11

The v1.2.x cycle outgrew patch scope — what started as "v1.2.1 approval workflow + interactive shell" closed *both* lead roadmap items, swept five Cyrius 4.5 → 5.10 stdlib regressions across deferred modules, and added a six-label audit-result vocabulary. Bumped to v1.3.0 to reflect the actual scope.

**Approval workflow battle-tested interactively** — every `-c` invocation now prints `Risk: [LOW|MED|HIGH|CRIT]` with `WARNING: BLOCKED` / `Approval required` lines as appropriate; `src/approval.cyr` and `src/audit.cyr` and `src/security.cyr` all wired into the binary's include graph. Audit-log JSON line per command (timestamp + user + mode + input + action + approved 0/1 + result), real wall-clock timestamps via `lib/chrono.cyr::iso8601_now()`, six-class `result` field (`proposed`, `needs_approval`, `blocked`, `needs_llm`, `needs_exec`, `rejected_safety`) so downstream filters can `jq 'select(.result == "rejected_safety")'`. Sudo path re-verified for existence AND root-ownership at the escalation moment via `verify_sudo_path` — closes the TOCTOU window between session-init cache and actual sudo invocation.

**Interactive shell end-to-end** — mode-aware prompt (`[ASSIST] >`, `[HUMAN] >`, `[STRICT] >`, `[AUTO] >`), `mode` / `history` / `clear` / `help` builtins, persistent command history at `$HOME/.agnsh_history` (last 1000 entries) loaded on session start, line-oriented `read_line` byte-reader for piped + terminal use, error-recovery `Hint:` lines surfacing parse-succeeded-but-translation-not-runnable cases (LLM-routed questions, pipelines, safety-rejected translations).

**Five deferred modules unbusted**. The v1.1.0 toolchain migration left silent build breaks in every module not in the agnsh binary's include graph. This cycle swept:
- **audit.cyr** — `str_cat(cstring, *)` × 3; `fs_exists` / `json_get_str` / `file_read_all` arity (read-side `AuditViewer_query` body gutted, MCP-routed AUDIT_VIEW is the user-facing path)
- **security.cyr** — `fs_exists` → `file_exists` × 5; `file_read_all` arity; `process_exec` → `exec_vec`; `str_data(cstring)` mismatch; `streq(Str, Str)` → `str_eq` (caught by Cyrius 5.10.x's type-warning hint — first time the toolchain caught one of these)
- **history.cyr** — `fs_exists`/`file_read_all`/`file_write_all` arity; `fs_parent`/`fs_mkdir_p` removed; `streq` → `str_eq`; entry-data-lifetime fix (`str_clone(str_from(...))` to break aliasing with the reused interactive_loop static buf); explicit byte-separator workaround for `str_split` cstring-needle dispatch
- **translate.cyr** — `is_safe_path` / `is_safe_arg` were cstring-only but the parser hands `Str`; added `safe_path_in_str` / `safe_arg_in_str` variants and routed all 11 translator call sites. **Every NL filesystem operation (copy / move / remove / mkdir / show-file / find / search-content) had been silently routing to `translate_unknown` since v1.0** because of this — now `agnsh -c "copy a to b"` correctly prints `Command: cp / Risk: [MED]` instead of `Command: echo / Risk: [LOW]`.
- **sanitize.cyr** — already swept in v1.2.0 slice 1; v1.3.0 carries the str_substr migration + new Str-aware variants

### Added

- **agnsh.cyr — runtime wire-up** of approval/audit/history/chrono; `audit_log_path` / `history_path` cstring builders; `audit_one_shot` with mode-aware + tag-aware classification; `classify_audit_result` six-label classifier; `print_intent_result` with risk-line + Hint:-line dispatch; `interactive_loop` with `ModeManager` + `CommandHistory` + `read_line` + builtin dispatch (help / version / mode / mode `<name>` / history / clear / exit / quit).
- **sanitize.cyr — Str-aware safety predicates** (`safe_path_in_str`, `safe_arg_in_str`, `path_traversal_in_str`, `shell_metachars_in_str`); `is_word_prefix` token-prefix matcher (plural-tolerance + substring-trap immunity); `input_starts_with` interrogative-form gate.
- **interpreter.cyr — new NL paths** — `parse_state_queries` (noun-phrase queries: ip address / my ip / uptime / disk space / running processes / etc.), `parse_service_query` (`is X running` / `is X active` / `is X enabled` / `status of X`), `parse_service_action` (bare imperative `start X` / `stop X` / `restart X` / `reload X` / `enable X` / `disable X`); `token_count` whitespace tokenizer.
- **security.cyr — `verify_sudo_path`** — escalation-time existence + root-ownership re-check.
- **scripts/check-coverage.sh** — fn-level coverage gate, ≥80% threshold, wired into `.github/workflows/ci.yml`. Current: 86%.
- **tests/test_core.tcyr** — 44 new assertions across approval workflow (20), audit JSON shape (11), security context + sudo gate (11), coverage anchors. Test count 257 → **301**.
- **scripts/smoke-test.sh** — 27 new assertions across interactive mode/history/exit (9), audit shape (4), audit result vocabulary (6), Hint: surfacing (4), command-field populated (1), risk-line per level (3). Smoke 31 → **58**.

### Fixed

- All five-module stdlib regressions listed above.
- **agnsh.cyr** — `str_print(cmd)` where `cmd` was a cstring command literal (e.g. `"ls"`, `"systemctl"`); pre-v1.3.0 the `Command:` line silently printed empty because `load64(s+8)` read past the cstring as a fake Str length. Now `str_print(str_from(cmd))`.
- **Interactive banner** — was hardcoded `agnoshi 1.1.0`; now uses `VERSION_STR`.
- **aarch64 cross-build** — three direct `syscall(SYS_*, ...)` sites broke the aarch64 CI cross-build because aarch64's generic syscall table doesn't expose bare SYS_OPEN (= io_setup there), SYS_CHMOD (only fchmodat), or SYS_STAT (with a different `struct stat` layout). Switched to the per-arch wrappers `sys_open` / `sys_chmod` / `sys_stat` (lib/syscalls_{x86,aarch64}_linux.cyr both export them) in `audit.cyr`, `history.cyr`, and `security.cyr`. The st_uid offset in `verify_sudo_path` is now `#ifdef`-gated per the architecture's `struct stat` layout (x86=28, aarch64=24). Both arches now build clean: x86_64 293,824 B, aarch64 337,032 B.

### Notes

- **Binary size**: 280,344 B (v1.2.0) → **293,824 B** (+13.5 KB). Growth from approval.cyr + audit.cyr + history.cyr + lib/chrono.cyr now in the include graph, plus the new parser helpers + safety predicates + audit/result vocabulary.
- **Coverage**: holds at 86% — the denominator grew with five newly-included modules; numerator grew through smoke + test_core additions to stay above the 80% gate.
- **Bug-class lesson** — five Cyrius 4.5 → 5.10 stdlib regression patterns surfaced over the v1.2.0 + v1.3.0 arc: `str_len(cstring)`, `str_sub(start, end)` semantics, `str_cat(cstring, *)` / `str_cat(*, cstring)`, `is_safe_path(Str)`, and renames (`fs_exists` / `process_exec` / `file_read_all` / `file_write_all` arity). Cyrius 5.10.x's type-warning hint caught one (`streq` in slice 5); the rest still surface as silent runtime fallthroughs. A static-analyzer pass for "cstring passed where `Str` is typed" is queued for v1.4.0 tooling.
- **What's deferred** — Tab completion (terminal raw mode + tty escapes); LLM response streaming (waits on hoosh modernization); exec wire-up for SAFE/READ_ONLY commands; `undo` builtin (needs exec wire-up). All slotted for v1.4.0. The v1.3.1 P(-1) audit/review pass per [agnosticos first-party standards](https://github.com/MacCracken/agnosticos/blob/main/docs/development/planning/first-party-standards.md) sits between.

---

**Detailed slice history below** — slices 1-9 documented as they landed (decision UI risk-print, audit-log shape, sudo timing, mode switching + line-oriented stdin, command history, error-recovery hints, audit result vocabulary, plus two bug-class audit sweeps).

### Slice 9 — audit result enrichment (this cut)

#### Added
- **agnsh.cyr: `classify_audit_result(tag, perm, desc_cstr)`** — maps the parse+translate outcome to one of six audit-result labels. Mirrors slice 8's Hint: lines so the user-facing surface and the audit JSON tell the same story. Order-sensitive: QUESTION / PIPELINE tag checks come first because PIPELINE has no translator arm and falls through to `translate_unknown` (stamping the same `"Unknown intent"` description that a real safety-rejected translation does); without the tag-first order, pipelines would mis-classify as `rejected_safety`. Six labels:
  - `rejected_safety` — translator safety check rejected the input (path traversal, shell metachars, leading-dash commit message, null PID, etc.)
  - `needs_llm` — QUESTION tag: LLM streaming not yet wired
  - `needs_exec` — PIPELINE tag: no translator arm
  - `blocked` — BLOCKED permission level
  - `needs_approval` — HIGH risk (SYSTEM_WRITE / ADMIN): would require an interactive approval prompt
  - `proposed` — SAFE / READ_ONLY / USER_WRITE: auto-runnable, logged as-is until exec wire-up lands (at which point this label flips to `executed` / `denied` / `error` at the exec call site)
- **agnsh.cyr: `audit_one_shot` extended signature** — now takes `(input, cmd, perm, mode_label, tag, desc)` and delegates the result classification. `print_intent_result` passes `tag` and `load64(translation + 16)` (the description cstring) through.
- **scripts/smoke-test.sh — 6 new audit-result assertions** — one input per label class, each verified via grep against the on-disk audit log. The `input` prefix in each grep is the parser's deduplication anchor: `'"input":"show files".*"result":"proposed"'` etc. Smoke 52 → **58**.

#### Notes
- **Binary size**: 293,312 → 293,824 B (+0.5 KB) — six cstring labels + the classifier dispatch.
- **Probe**: a single `-c` cycle through `show files / install vim / rm /tmp/x / what is dns / ls | grep foo / remove ../etc/passwd` produces six audit lines with all six result labels in order. The `result` field is now the single grep-target for "what did agnoshi actually do".
- **Coverage** holds at 86%. `classify_audit_result` gains transitive coverage via smoke (each of the six labels exercised end-to-end); the classifier's ordering bug from the first probe (PIPELINE → rejected_safety) was caught by the smoke probe itself, not unit tests — direct unit tests would be a follow-up.
- **Forward compat**: when exec wires up, `audit_one_shot` will take an additional `exec_result` arg and the `proposed` label will be replaced at the call site with `executed` / `denied` / `error`. The other five labels (`needs_*`, `blocked`, `rejected_safety`) stay — they describe parse-time decisions, not runtime outcomes.

### Slice 8 — interactive shell: error-recovery hints (committed)

#### Added
- **agnsh.cyr: post-translation `Hint:` line** in `print_intent_result`. Three classes:
  - **QUESTION (tag 42)** — LLM streaming isn't wired; the parser classified the input as a question but agnoshi can only echo. Hint: `question intent -- LLM streaming arrives in a later slice`.
  - **PIPELINE (tag 41)** — no `translate_pipeline` arm in `translate_core` / `translate_extended`, so the dispatch falls to `translate_unknown` (echo, SAFE). Hint: `pipeline intent -- auto-exec arrives with the exec wire-up`.
  - **Safety-rejected translation** — any tag whose `translate_X` called `is_safe_path_str` / `is_safe_arg_str` / `is_valid_pid` / `is_safe_commit_message` on a parser-extracted field and the predicate rejected. Detected by the `"Unknown intent"` description that `translate_unknown` stamps. Hint: `translator safety check rejected this input -- try rephrasing`. This is the actual v1.2.1 error-recovery sub-bullet: pre-slice-8 a user typing `remove ../etc/passwd` saw `Command: echo / Risk: [LOW]` and could plausibly believe the deletion was queued; now the rejection is surfaced.
- **scripts/smoke-test.sh — 4 new hint assertions**: each of the three hint classes appears for a matching input; happy-path inputs (`show me files`) do *not* carry a `Hint:` line (negative check, no false-positive). Smoke 48 → **52**.

#### Notes
- **Binary size**: 292,920 → 293,312 B (+0.4 KB) — three println strings and one streq.
- **Order of output** preserved: Risk line still shows the technical classification first (some callers / scripts may want the raw permission level even on echo-only translations); the Hint follows. BLOCKED warnings still print before the Hint (a BLOCKED translation that's also safety-rejected gets both lines, which is the correct surface area).
- **Audit unchanged this slice** — the audit entry still records `action="echo"` for these cases. A future slice could enrich audit with a separate `result` field value like `"rejected_safety"` / `"needs_llm"` / `"needs_exec"` to distinguish from real echo invocations, but the user-facing print is the higher-leverage fix and stands alone.
- **Remaining v1.2.1 interactive-shell sub-items**: completion (tab) and streaming LLM responses. Both need bigger infrastructure (completion: terminal raw mode + tty escape handling; streaming: hoosh wire-up). At this point the interactive shell is fully usable end-to-end for the parse-and-classify use case; the remaining items light up *execution* paths.

### Slice 7 — interactive shell: command history (committed)

#### Fixed
- **src/history.cyr — Cyrius 5.10.x stdlib alignment**. Same shape as slice-5's security.cyr repair: four latent bugs that compile-broke any wire-up attempt.
  - `fs_exists` (2 sites) → `file_exists` (per lib/io.cyr 5.10.x).
  - `file_read_all(path)` single-arg → buffer-based `(path, buf, maxlen)`. Reworked `CommandHistory_new` to alloc a 64 KB scratch buffer, read the file, null-terminate, wrap as Str for `str_split`.
  - `file_write_all(path, content)` two-arg → `(path, buf, len)`. `CommandHistory_save` now passes `str_data(content)` + `str_len(content)`.
  - `fs_parent` / `fs_mkdir_p` — don't exist in 5.10.x stdlib. Removed the parent-dir-create call; `$HOME` is the conventional parent and is guaranteed to exist when the shell starts.
- **history dedup**: `streq(last, command)` was a Str/cstring type mismatch (entries are Str from str_split / str_clone; command was cstring) — replaced with `str_eq(Str, Str)`. Pre-slice-7 dedup never matched, so a flood of identical inputs would have all stuck. Caught by Cyrius 5.10.x's type-warning hint at first build attempt.
- **history entry data lifetime**: `CommandHistory_add` was `str_from(command_cstr)` which BORROWS the cstring buffer. interactive_loop reuses one static `var buf[4096]` across iterations, so every history entry's data pointer would alias to whatever was in `&buf` at display time — first probe showed all entries dereferencing to the same garbled bytes. Now `str_clone(str_from(command_cstr))` deep-copies into a fresh heap buffer so the stored Str is independent of the caller's scratch.
- **load-side str_split**: `str_split(content, "\n")` returned the whole file as one entry — the cstring-needle dispatch path didn't route the way audit/translate calls do. Switched to explicit byte separator `str_split(content, 10)` (where 10 is `'\n'`). Persisted multi-line history files now load with the correct entry count.

#### Added
- **agnsh.cyr: `history_path()`** — `$HOME/.agnsh_history` cstring builder, mirrors `audit_log_path` shape. Falls back to `/tmp/agnsh_history` when HOME is unset.
- **`CommandHistory` wired into `interactive_loop`** — loads from disk on session start (last 1000 lines); every non-builtin input gets recorded; `CommandHistory_save` writes the file back on `exit` / `quit`.
- **`history` builtin** — prints the last 20 entries with 1-indexed numbering. `(history empty)` when the list is empty (vs silently printing nothing — discoverability).
- **`help` updated** — mentions `history` builtin and that `exit/quit` save history.
- **scripts/smoke-test.sh — 8 new history assertions**: entry recording (entries 1 and 2 appear in the in-session `history` output), file creation, file line count, file content shape, persistence across sessions (next invocation's `history` shows the same entries), empty-history path. Smoke 40 → **48**.

#### Notes
- **Binary size**: 289,896 → 292,920 B (+3.0 KB) — history.cyr's CommandHistory body + the new `history_path` builder + the history builtin's display loop.
- **Coverage** holds at **86%**; new history fns gain transitive coverage via the smoke tests, no direct unit anchors yet (load+save are I/O-bound and exercised end-to-end through smoke).
- **Remaining v1.2.1 interactive-shell sub-items**: completion (tab), error recovery loop, streaming LLM. Completion needs terminal raw mode + tty escape handling. Streaming needs hoosh wire-up. Error-recovery loop is the smallest of the three.

### Slice 6 — interactive shell: mode switching + line-oriented stdin (committed)

#### Added
- **agnsh.cyr: `read_line(buf, maxlen)`** — byte-by-byte stdin reader that delivers one line per call. The previous `syscall(SYS_READ, 0, &buf, 4095)` worked in a real terminal (line discipline serves one line per read) but collapsed multi-line piped input into a single buffer, so the loop's line-oriented dispatch (`streq` against builtins) failed under any kind of scripted invocation. Byte-by-byte is slow per char but correct for both modes; terminal users see no difference (the tty's local echo handles visible feedback before \n arrives).
- **agnsh.cyr: mode-aware interactive_loop** — owns a `ModeManager` starting at `Mode.AI_ASSISTED` (matches `ShellConfig_default`'s default_mode). The prompt now carries the current mode prefix (`[ASSIST] >`, `[HUMAN] >`, `[STRICT] >`, `[AUTO] >`) via `mode_prompt_prefix`, so the AI-autonomy level is visible before every input. Pre-slice-6 the prompt was a bare `> ` regardless of mode.
- **agnsh.cyr: `mode` builtin** — no-arg form prints current mode + the available list; `mode <name>` switches when name ∈ `{auto, assist, human, strict}`. Unknown names error with the available list (surface vs silent failure). Bookkeeping helper `try_mode_switch(mgr, arg_cstr)` maps the CLI names to enum values and pulls `ModeManager_switch`.
- **agnsh.cyr: `clear` builtin** — emits the ANSI ED (`\x1b[2J`) + CUP (`\x1b[H`) pair to clear screen + home cursor. Matches the man-page entry that had been undocumented in the actual code.
- **agnsh.cyr: `help` expanded** — now lists every builtin with its arg shape (was a 2-line summary that omitted mode/clear).
- **agnsh.cyr: mode-aware audit entries** — `print_intent_result` now takes a `mode_label_cstr` and threads it into `audit_one_shot`. Interactive invocations write the actual `mode_display` label (`"AI-ASSIST"`, `"HUMAN"`, etc.) into the audit JSON's `mode` field; `-c` continues to log as `"auto"` (one-shot non-interactive). Downstream audit filters can now distinguish interactive-human sessions from interactive-auto from script-driven `-c`.
- **scripts/smoke-test.sh — 9 new interactive-loop assertions** driving the binary via piped stdin: assist start, `mode` reports current, switch to human, prompt updates after switch, switch to strict, NL parses under mode, exit clean, unknown-mode errors deterministically, unknown-mode lists the available set. Smoke 31 → **40**.

#### Notes
- **Binary size**: 288,040 → 289,896 B (+1.8 KB) — mode-prompt helper + read_line byte-loop + builtin parsing.
- **Coverage** holds at **86%**; the new helpers (`read_line`, `try_mode_switch`) gain transitive coverage through the smoke tests but are also reachable directly through the agnsh include graph.
- **Remaining v1.2.1 interactive-shell sub-items**: history (recall previous commands), completion (tab), error recovery loop, streaming LLM responses. History + error recovery are the next natural slices; completion + streaming both need bigger infrastructure (terminal raw mode for completion, hoosh wire-up for streaming).

### Slice 5 — security.cyr: sudo re-verification timing (committed)

#### Fixed
- **src/security.cyr — Cyrius 5.10.x stdlib alignment**. Four latent breaks accumulated since v1.0 because the module isn't (yet) in any binary's include graph, so the build never tripped on them:
  - `fs_exists` (5 call sites in `security_check_sudo` + `execute_with_privileges`) — renamed to `file_exists` (per `lib/io.cyr` 5.10.x).
  - `file_read_all("/etc/passwd")` single-arg form in `security_get_username` — Cyrius 5.10.x's `file_read_all(path, buf, maxlen): i64` is buffer-based; reworked to alloc a 64 KB heap buffer (lifetime survives the function return so the `vec_get(fields, 0)` Str's data pointer stays valid), call file_read_all with it, null-terminate, wrap as Str for str_split.
  - `process_exec(cmd, argv)` in `execute_command` — function doesn't exist in 5.10.x's `lib/process.cyr`. Replaced with `exec_vec(argv)` (the 5.10.x form that handles fork + execve + waitpid internally with cmd at argv[0]).
  - `str_data("/usr/bin/sudo")` in `execute_with_privileges` — same Cyrius 4.5 → 5.10 type-confusion class that bit slices 1/7/8/3: `str_data` reads `load64(s)` expecting a Str fat pointer, but the cstring literal there means it returned garbage as the path. The stat() syscall now takes the cstring directly.
  - **Plus** `streq(field_uid, uid_str)` — both sides are Str (from `str_split` + `str_from_int`), but `streq` is cstring-typed. Replaced with `str_eq` (lib/str.cyr's Str variant). Cyrius 5.10.x's new type-warning hint flagged this on build — same shape as the earlier Str/cstring mismatches but caught by the toolchain this time.

#### Added
- **`verify_sudo_path` extraction** — the inline existence-check + stat-based ownership-check in `execute_with_privileges` is now a named helper. Re-verifies at the escalation moment (not at session init) that `sudo_path` (cstring) **(a) exists on disk now** AND **(b) is owned by uid 0**. Closes the TOCTOU window between session-start cache and actual escalation: a long-running session may survive a sudo binary swap, deletion, or ownership flip; trusting `SecurityContext.sudo_available` alone would let the binary attempt sudo against a now-untrustworthy path. Caller `execute_with_privileges` now tries `/usr/bin/sudo` then `/bin/sudo` through `verify_sudo_path`, returning `-3` (sudo present but not root-owned) vs `-2` (sudo missing) so the failure mode is actionable.
- **Return-code contract documented** — `execute_with_privileges` return codes now have an inline contract block: `0+` exit code, `-1` restricted mode, `-2` sudo unavailable, `-3` sudo present but not root-owned. Pre-v1.2.1 the return codes were undocumented; downstream callers had to read the body to disambiguate.
- **tests/test_core.tcyr — 11 new security assertions** (and `_mock_sec` helper to compose a `SecurityContext` by hand, sidestepping the runtime UID dependency):
  - `SecurityContext_is_root` — yes / no paths.
  - `SecurityContext_is_restricted` — yes / no paths.
  - `SecurityContext_can_escalate` — full gate matrix: normal user OK; restricted blocked; sudo missing blocked; root blocked. **This is the v1.2.1 contract**: three independent guards, all must pass.
  - `verify_sudo_path` — happy path against `/usr/bin/sudo` (gated by `file_exists` so containers without sudo skip cleanly); deterministic negative against `/nonexistent/sudo/path`.
  - `security_check_sudo` — at-init coarse check agrees with the per-call `verify_sudo_path` (the integration invariant between cache and re-verifier).
  - Test count 290 → **301**.
- **`src/security.cyr` now in tests/test_core.tcyr's include graph** — was unreferenced previously. Future stdlib drift in security.cyr now surfaces as a build failure, not a runtime crash on first escalation attempt.

#### Notes
- **Not wired into `agnsh.cyr`** — security.cyr stays test-only this slice because the binary's `-c` mode still prints translations without executing them. When the exec wire-up lands (interactive-shell slice or later v1.2.1), the `agnsh.cyr` include + `SecurityContext_new` at startup is one additional line. The fixes here just make sure security.cyr is *ready* — a v1.2.x interactive-shell slice can trust the module to compile + behave on first wire-up rather than discovering the four bugs at integration time.
- **Bug-class lesson** — five Cyrius 4.5 → 5.10 stdlib regressions surfaced over the v1.2.0+v1.2.1 arc: `str_len(cstring)`, `str_sub(start, end)` semantics, `str_cat` first-arg cstring, `str_cat` second-arg cstring, `is_safe_path(Str)`, and now `process_exec` rename / `file_read_all` arity / `fs_exists` rename. The `streq(Str, Str)` case in this slice WAS caught by Cyrius 5.10.x's new type-warning hint — first time the toolchain caught one of these. Other variants are still silent; the queued static-analysis slice remains warranted.
- **Coverage** — denominator grew (security.cyr added 9 fns to the in-binary-scope set since it's now included by test_core); coverage held at **86%** (107/124). Capacity, fmt, lint, build, smoke all clean.

### Slice 4 — audit-log wire-up + JSON-shape coverage (committed)

#### Added
- **agnsh.cyr: `audit_one_shot` + `audit_log_path`** — every `-c` invocation now appends one JSON line to `$HOME/.agnsh_audit.log` (falls back to `/tmp/agnsh_audit.log` when `HOME` is unset for test harnesses / restricted envs). Path is constructed as a null-terminated cstring (manual buffer + `memcpy` because `lib/str.cyr::str_cat` returns a length-prefixed buffer with no trailing zero, and `syscall(SYS_OPEN)` wants cstring). The audit entry carries `user="user"`, `mode="auto"`, `input=<raw NL input>`, `action=<translated command>`, `approved={0,1}` derived from permission level (SAFE/READ_ONLY/USER_WRITE auto-approved; SYSTEM_WRITE/ADMIN/BLOCKED not), `result="proposed"` (will flip to `executed`/`denied`/`error` when the exec wire-up lands in the interactive-shell slice).
- **agnsh.cyr: real timestamp** — `chrono_now_rfc3339` now wraps `lib/chrono.cyr::iso8601_now()` (real wall-clock via `clock_gettime` syscall) instead of returning the v1.0-era fixed `"2026-04-13T00:00:00Z"` stub. `lib/chrono.cyr` is now in the binary's include graph.
- **audit.cyr now wired into `agnsh.cyr`** — was test-only previously. The dead-coded `AuditViewer_query` body was stripped (`return vec_new()`) because the AUDIT_VIEW intent already routes through MCP via `translate_audit_view`, and the in-process file-read fallback needs a stdlib API alignment (`fs_exists` → `file_exists` rename, `json_get_str` → `json_get` rename, `file_read_all` arity change) that's bigger than this slice. Slot for that alignment: the AUDIT_VIEW read-path slice in v1.2.x.
- **tests/test_core.tcyr — audit-log JSON shape coverage** — 11 new field-level assertions on `AuditEntry_to_json`: every field present + correctly JSON-quoted (`timestamp`, `user`, `mode`, `input`, `action`, `result`); `approved` serialized as a raw integer (not a quoted string — locks the contract downstream parsers depend on); JSON-string escaping for embedded `"` in the `input` field (locks the v1.0 audit C4 mitigation from the audit side too); `AuditLogger_log` writes a complete line to disk and the file is readable afterward. Substring-based assertions throughout so each contract gets one explicit check rather than one giant strict-equality line that would bust the 120-char lint cap. Test count 277 → **290**.
- **scripts/smoke-test.sh — end-to-end audit log checks** — 4 new assertions: log file is created at `$HOME/.agnsh_audit.log` after a `-c` invocation; LOW-risk command produces `"action":"ls","approved":1`; BLOCKED command produces `"action":"rm","approved":0`; line count matches invocation count (verifies append-mode + newline terminator). Smoke count 27 → **31**.

#### Notes
- **Binary size**: 284,504 → 288,040 B (+3.5 KB) — `lib/chrono.cyr` time helpers + `src/audit.cyr` JSON serializer + the `audit_log_path` cstring builder.
- **Coverage**: stays at **86%** (107/124). The denominator grew (audit.cyr added 8 fns, agnsh.cyr added 2) but the explicit new tests + coverage anchors held the percentage steady.
- **Verification**: `HOME=/tmp ./build/agnsh -c "show me files"` writes `{"timestamp":"2026-05-11T16:15:04Z","user":"user","mode":"auto","input":"show me files","action":"ls","approved":1,"result":"proposed"}` to `/tmp/.agnsh_audit.log`. Second invocation appends the next line. JSON is shellcheck-clean and `jq .` parses each line.
- **Remaining v1.2.1 sub-items** — sudo re-verification timing (the third "battle-tested" bullet) and the full interactive-shell loop (history, prompt, mode switching, completion, error recovery, streaming LLM) are still open. Sudo-timing is small and likely the next bite.

### Slice 3 — approval runtime wire-up + safety-predicate Str-fix (committed)

#### Fixed
- **sanitize.cyr: Str-aware safety predicates** — added `has_path_traversal_str`, `has_shell_metachars_str`, `is_safe_path_str`, `is_safe_arg_str` (named with full `_str` suffix initially, then renamed to `safe_path_in_str` / `safe_arg_in_str` / etc. after the original convention turned out to trigger an unintended Cyrius name-mangling overload). All 11 call sites in `src/translate.cyr` now route through the Str-aware variants. The cstring-form `is_safe_path` / `is_safe_arg` are kept in place for the tests that pass cstring literals and for `permissions.cyr` cstring callers. **Behavior impact**: pre-v1.2.1 `agnsh -c "copy a to b"` printed `Risk: [LOW]` (because translate_copy fell through to `translate_unknown` → `echo`); now correctly prints `Risk: [MED]` with `Command: cp`. Same fix unlocks `move`, `remove`, `create directory`, `find files named ...`, `search for ... in ...`, and `read <file>` NL paths.
- **agnsh.cyr: print Command via Str wrap** — `str_print(cmd)` where `cmd` is a translator-stored cstring (e.g., `"ls"`, `"git"`, `"systemctl"`) caused `str_print`'s `load64(s+8)` to read garbage as a length; the line silently printed nothing. Now `str_print(str_from(cmd))` wraps the cstring on the fly. Pre-v1.2.1 every `-c` invocation showed `Command: ` blank.
- **agnsh.cyr: interactive banner version drift** — banner string was hardcoded `agnoshi 1.1.0`; replaced with `VERSION_STR` so future bumps stay in sync.
- **Second-position str_cat sweep (slice 2)** — `str_cat(X, "...")` cstring-in-second-position pattern fixed at 7 latent call sites in `aliases.cyr`, `checkpoint.cyr` ×3, `audit.cyr`, `prompt.cyr`, `session.cyr`. Same Cyrius 4.5 → 5.10 stdlib drift as slice 8's first-position sweep.

#### Added
- **agnsh.cyr: approval risk-print in `-c` mode** — `src/approval.cyr` now wired into the binary's include graph (was only in tests). Every `-c` invocation now prints `Risk: [LOW|MED|HIGH|CRIT]` (assessed via `risk_from_permission`) in place of the bare permission integer. `BLOCKED` permission surfaces an explicit `WARNING: BLOCKED -- would not execute without explicit override`; HIGH risk surfaces `Approval required (interactive prompt in shell mode)`. Interactive prompt itself (`ApprovalManager_request` with stdin reads) is queued for the next slice.
- **scripts/smoke-test.sh** — 7 new assertions on the new `-c` output shape: risk label for each of the four risk levels, the BLOCKED warning line, the HIGH-risk approval hint, and `Command: ls` populated (locking the str_print-cstring fix in CI). Smoke count 20 → **27**.
- **tests/test_core.tcyr — approval coverage (slice 1, retained)** — 20 assertions for `src/approval.cyr` (first time covered): full `risk_from_permission` mapping, `risk_icon` labels, `ApprovalManager_assess_risk` for representative commands across risk levels, `ApprovalManager_is_blocked` pattern-add behavior, `ApprovalManager_set_auto_approve` toggle.

#### Notes
- **Test count**: 257 → **277** (slice 1 + slice 3). The Str-fielded translator-test rewrite that came out of slice 3 (every `store64(*_intent + N, "...")` for safety-checking translators now wraps in `str_from`) keeps the existing 20 translator assertions passing under the new contract — total stays at 277 because slice 3 added no new test entries, only updated existing fixtures to the actual production contract.
- **Binary size**: 280,344 B (post-slice-2) → 284,504 B (+4.1 KB). Growth from approval.cyr's include into the binary + the new `is_safe_path_str` / `is_safe_arg_str` helpers.
- **Coverage**: 89% → 86%. The denominator grew (approval.cyr's 8 fns and the four `_str` safety helpers all entered the in-binary scope) faster than tests added direct anchors for them; still well above the 80% gate.
- **Bug-class lesson** — three Cyrius 4.5 → 5.10 stdlib regressions surfaced over the v1.2.0+1.2.1 arc: `str_len(cstring)` mis-read, `str_sub(start, end)` semantics flip, `str_cat(cstring, *)` / `str_cat(*, cstring)` type mismatch, and now the `is_safe_path(Str)` type mismatch. None are caught by the build — all surfaced as silent runtime fallthroughs or segfaults. A static analyzer pass for "cstring passed to fn typed `Str`" would catch the whole class; queued as a v1.2.x or v1.3.x tooling slice.

### Slice 2 — second-position str_cat sweep + approval coverage debut (committed)

### Fixed
- **Second-position str_cat bug-class sweep** — slice 8's audit only checked `str_cat("...", X)` (cstring as first arg). The dual case `str_cat(X, "...")` (cstring as second arg) is *also* broken because `lib/str.cyr`'s `str_cat(a: Str, b: Str)` types both sides — passing a raw cstring for `b` causes the function to read `load64(cstring+8)` as a Str length header (garbage). 7 latent sites fixed across `aliases.cyr` (expansion suffix space), `checkpoint.cyr` ×3 (HOME-relative checkpoint dir + backup-name infixes), `audit.cyr` (`"..."` truncation suffix), `prompt.cyr` (`/.git/HEAD` path build), `session.cyr` (HOME-relative history path). All in modules deferred to v1.2.x wire-up; same hygiene rationale as slice 8.

### Added
- **tests/test_core.tcyr — approval workflow coverage** — 20 new assertions exercising `src/approval.cyr` (first time the module has unit tests):
  - `risk_from_permission` — full mapping locked: SAFE/READ_ONLY → LOW, USER_WRITE → MEDIUM, SYSTEM_WRITE/ADMIN → HIGH, BLOCKED → CRITICAL.
  - `risk_icon` — UI label strings (`[LOW]`, `[MED]`, `[HIGH]`, `[CRIT]`) locked. When the interactive approval dialog ships in slice 10+, drift here would silently break the on-screen risk indicator.
  - `ApprovalManager_assess_risk` — end-to-end risk for representative commands (`ls` → LOW, `cp` → MEDIUM, `apt` → HIGH, `dd` → CRITICAL). Tests the composition of `analyze_command_permission` + `risk_from_permission`.
  - `ApprovalManager_is_blocked` — pattern blocklist (substring match). Default-empty + add-pattern + matching cmd + unrelated cmd all locked.
  - `ApprovalManager_set_auto_approve` — toggle bit at offset 8 locked in both directions.
  - Test count 257 → **277**, all passing.
- **approval.cyr now wired into tests/test_core.tcyr** — the test binary now compiles + links the module, which means future regressions (e.g. another stdlib drift) surface as build failures rather than runtime crashes on first use.

### Notes
- `ApprovalManager_request` itself (the interactive dialog) is *not* covered yet — it does `syscall(SYS_READ, 0, ...)` to read keyboard input, which can't be exercised in a unit-test harness. That branch lands in slice 10's interactive-shell wiring with an injection seam for testable I/O.
- Binary size unchanged at 280,344 B (approval.cyr only landed in the test binary, not in `agnsh.cyr`'s include graph yet — the runtime wire-up is the next slice).

## [1.2.0] - 2026-05-11

The v1.2.0 cycle closed out all three roadmap items: deeper intent parsing (slices 1-4), all-core-translators production-tested (slices 5-7), and a coverage report wired into CI (slice 9, 89% fn-level coverage against an 80% threshold). Slice 8 was a bug-class audit pass that swept `src/` for the same `(cstring, Str)`-where-`(Str, Str)`-expected pattern that bit slices 1 and 7, fixing 10 latent call sites across `prompt.cyr`, `security.cyr`, `checkpoint.cyr`, `sanitize.cyr`, and `session.cyr` — all in modules deferred to the v1.2.x interactive-shell wire-up, but now correct ahead of that work.

### Fixed
- **translate.cyr: `translate_audit_view` / `translate_agent_info`** — both built MCP JSON bodies via `str_cat("{\"agent\":\"", agent_str)`. `lib/str.cyr`'s `str_cat` takes `(Str, Str)` on 5.10.x, and passing a cstring as the first arg causes `load64(cstring)` to be read as a Str header (garbage length). Binary segfaulted any time the user asked for an audit view (`"show audit log"`) or queried agent info. Both literals now wrapped in `str_from()`. Verified by translator tests AND end-to-end against the binary (`./build/agnsh -c "show audit"` no longer crashes).
- **Bug-class audit pass** — 10 additional `str_cat(cstring, Str)` call sites swept from `src/`: `prompt.cyr` (path `~` abbreviation), `security.cyr` x2 (`uid_` username fallbacks), `checkpoint.cyr` x2 (rollback message formatting), `sanitize.cyr` x3 (`build_safe_env` for `HOME=` / `LANG=` / `TERM=`), `session.cyr` x2 (cd-error message). All in modules not currently linked into the agnsh binary; fixing them ahead of v1.2.x's interactive-shell wire-up keeps the same Cyrius 4.5 → 5.10 stdlib-drift bug class from biting once those modules ship.
- **sanitize.cyr (slice 1, retained)** — `str_contains_ci`, `str_find_ci`, `str_find_ci_from`, `str_split_ci` were calling `str_len(needle)` / `str_data(needle)` on a cstring needle. Garbage length, every `input_has_word()` match silently false, every parsed intent fell to `SHELL_COMMAND`. Helpers now use `strlen()` for the cstring side and raw pointer arithmetic. Single root cause behind the "agnoshi can't parse NL" symptom on 5.10.x.
- **str_sub → str_substr migration (slice 1, retained)** — 19 call sites across `aliases.cyr`, `audit.cyr`, `commands.cyr`, `prompt.cyr`, `session.cyr`, `sanitize.cyr`, `interpreter.cyr` were passing end-positions to `str_sub(s, start, len)` (which takes a *length* on 5.10.x). Global rename to `str_substr` (the (start, end) variant).
- **interpreter.cyr: extract_after / extract_between (slice 1, retained)** — same `str_len(cstring keyword)` bug pattern; replaced with `strlen(keyword)` / `strlen(before_kw)`.

### Added

#### Slices 1-4 — Deeper intent parsing
- **parse_state_queries** — noun-phrase queries: `"ip address"`, `"my ip"`, `"network status"` → `NETWORK_INFO`; `"uptime"`, `"load average"`, `"kernel version"`, `"memory usage"`, `"hostname"` → `SYSTEM_INFO`; `"disk space"`, `"free space"`, `"how full"`, `"storage usage"` → `DISK_USAGE`; `"running processes"`, `"what's running"`, `"active processes"` → `SHOW_PROCESSES`.
- **parse_service_query** — `"is X running"` / `"is X active"` / `"is X enabled"` (gated on `input_starts_with("is ")` so statements like `"the application is running"` don't get hijacked) and `"status of X"` → `SERVICE_CONTROL` with action=status, target=X.
- **parse_service_action** — bare imperative form: `"start nginx"`, `"stop sshd"`, `"restart cron"`, `"reload nginx"`, `"enable cron"`, `"disable apache"` → `SERVICE_CONTROL`. Gated on `input_starts_with(verb)` at token 0 + `token_count == 2` so `"start a new project"` / `"stop wasting time"` keep falling through to `SHELL_COMMAND`. `parse_admin_ops` runs first so `"enable firewall"` / `"disable ufw"` correctly stay `FIREWALL_ENABLE` / `FIREWALL_DISABLE`.
- **sanitize.cyr: `is_word_prefix(input, word)`** — case-insensitive token-prefix matcher. Gives plural-tolerance (`"file"` matches `"files"`, `"process"` matches `"processes"`, `"directory"` matches `"directories"`) AND substring-trap immunity (`"move"` doesn't match inside `"remove"`, `"rm"` doesn't match inside `"warm"`). The previous trap-defense ordering hack (REMOVE-before-MOVE) is retired; the `"rm "` / `"move "` trailing-space anchors dropped.
- **sanitize.cyr: `input_starts_with(input, prefix_cstr)`** — case-insensitive prefix check, gates interrogative form for service queries.
- **interpreter.cyr: `input_has_word` auto-dispatch** — compound phrases (internal whitespace) keep substring matching; single-token needles route through `is_word_prefix`.
- **interpreter.cyr: `token_count`** — whitespace-delimited token counter, sanity gate for imperative service actions.

#### Slices 5-7 — Translator production tests
- **tests/test_core.tcyr — full translator-coverage block** — every `translate_X` in `src/translate.cyr` (43 translators) gets at least command + permission-level assertions; safety-check translators get explicit negative cases (path-traversal → unknown for `translate_show_file`, missing destination → unknown for `translate_copy`, null path → unknown for `translate_change_dir`, pid=0 → unknown for `translate_kill_process`, leading-dash commit message → unknown for `translate_git_commit` locking the v1.0 audit H7 mitigation, null action → unknown for `translate_service_control`). `translate_remove` BLOCKED permission level locked; `translate_shell_command`'s dynamic-permission derivation tested both arms (`"ls"` → READ_ONLY, `"apt"` → ADMIN). MCP-routing translators (`audit_view`, `agent_info`) have `mcp_tool` field-40 non-zero locked.

#### Slice 9 — Coverage report in CI
- **scripts/check-coverage.sh** — fn-level coverage gate. Cyrius doesn't ship line-coverage instrumentation, so the script counts top-level `fn` defs in the modules linked into the agnsh binary (`sanitize.cyr`, `mode.cyr`, `permissions.cyr`, `intent.cyr`, `commands.cyr`, `translate.cyr`, `interpreter.cyr`) and requires ≥80% to be referenced by name in `tests/test_core.tcyr` / `tests/test_security.tcyr`. Modules reserved for the v1.2.x interactive-shell wire-up (`session.cyr`, `ui.cyr`, `prompt.cyr`, `checkpoint.cyr`, etc.) are out-of-scope until that work lands. Current: 107 / 120 fns covered (89%), comfortably above the 80% threshold.
- **CI gate** — `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs `scripts/check-coverage.sh 80` after the smoke test. Below-threshold coverage now fails CI like fmt / lint / capacity drift.
- **tests/test_core.tcyr — coverage anchor block** — direct assertions for the helpers that were transitively exercised but never named in the test file: string ops (`str_byte_at`, `str_contains_ci`, `str_find_ci`, `str_find_ci_from`, `str_split_ci`, `strip_control_chars`, `print_str_safe`), the substring-trap matcher (`is_word_prefix`), permission classifiers (`is_blocked_command`, `is_readonly_command`, `is_write_command`, `is_safe_command`, `is_safe_arg`, `is_shell_metachar`), parser dispatch arms (`parse_show_commands`, `parse_file_ops`, `parse_system_ops`, `parse_git_ops`, `parse_admin_ops`, `parse_service_query`, `parse_service_action`, `parse_state_queries`), translator dispatch (`translate_core`, `translate_extended`), mode helpers (`mode_description`, `mode_prompt_prefix`, `ModeManager_toggle`), tokenizer (`token_count`, `split_command_line`, `str_to_int`), env builder (`build_safe_env`), and intent option-pack bit-accessors (`list_options_time`).

### Notes
- **Test count**: 57 → **257** (4.5× growth). 200 new assertions across parse-side coverage, translator coverage, and coverage-anchor blocks.
- **Binary size**: 271,832 B (1.1.0) → 280,344 B (+8.5 KB). Growth is the new parser helpers (`is_word_prefix`, `input_starts_with`, `token_count`, `parse_service_query`, `parse_service_action`, `parse_state_queries`) plus the `str_from()` wraps in the bug-class fixes. Still a single statically-linked ELF with zero runtime deps.
- **Parser performance** — parse benchmarks moved 1-2us (pre-slice-1 fast path was a no-op due to broken CI helpers) → 3-13us (parser walking actual branches with the substring-trap-immune word-prefix matcher). Still well under interactive-latency thresholds.
- **Bug-class audit findings** — the v1.1.0 toolchain migration left three distinct stdlib-semantics regressions in tree: `str_len(cstring)` (slice 1, sanitize + interpreter), `str_sub(start, end)` → length semantics (slice 1, 19 sites in 7 files), and `str_cat(cstring, Str)` (slices 7 + 8, 12 sites in 6 files). All swept. Recommended for the v1.2.x interactive-shell work: re-audit any module brought into the binary's include graph for the same patterns before wiring it in.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-05-10

Repair-focused modernization. No new shell features — toolchain bump + scaffolding parity with the rest of the AGNOS ecosystem.

### Documentation
- **doc closeout** — Five docs flagged Stale in the initial `doc-health.md` audit moved Fresh in the 1.1.0 closeout pass. Each refreshed in-place against the agnoshi shape (userland AI shell), not pasted from the agnosys playbook (kernel-interface library):
  - `README.md` — added a `1.1.0 · Cyrius 5.10.34 · 21 modules · ~4 K src lines · 272 KB static binary (DCE) · 0 runtime deps` stat-line; install instructions now lead with `cyrius deps`; the "146 KB" headline from 1.0.0 is reframed as a port-arc snapshot pointing at `benchmarks-rust-v-cyrius.md` with an in-tree refresh command; the `agnsh.cyr "v1.0 minimal"` annotation dropped (the entry shipped).
  - `CONTRIBUTING.md` — `cyrius deps` step added before build; cleanliness gate command list (`cyrius check / capacity / vet / fmt / lint`) documented inline matching the CI shape; cc3-era warnings purged (`//`-comment-with-colons mis-parse note, "40+ match arms may exceed per-fn limit"); Cyrius 5.10.x trailing-comma rule from the toolchain-bump notes carried in.
  - `docs/architecture/overview.md` — `lib/` reframed as "Cyrius stdlib (gitignored; populated by `cyrius deps` from the pinned snapshot)"; build-time requirement bumped `cyrius v4.3.0+` → `Cyrius 5.10.34 pinned in cyrius.cyml`; runtime size annotated with the 146 KB → 272 KB toolchain-side growth between 4.5.0 and 5.10.x.
  - `docs/agnsh.1` — `.TH` header bumped `April 2026 / agnoshi 1.0.0` → `May 2026 / agnoshi 1.1.0`. Command surface (modes, builtins, options, files) unchanged in 1.1.0 so the body needed no edits.
  - `benchmarks-rust-v-cyrius.md` — historical-port-arc framing added at the top; cc3-limit references called out as point-in-time and no longer applicable on Cyrius 5.10.34; in-tree refresh command (`cyrius build tests/bench_core.bcyr build/bench_core && ./build/bench_core`) wired in for current-toolchain numbers. Doc otherwise remains frozen by design.
- **doc-health.md** — bucket counts re-rolled (Fresh: 6 → 11), per-row entries for the five closeout items moved to ✅ Fresh with refresh notes; the one outstanding Open Strategic Question is now strictly `benchmarks-rust-v-cyrius.md`'s home (root vs `docs/`), deferred to 1.2.0 doc-sync.

### Changed
- **toolchain** — Cyrius pin bumped 4.5.0 → 5.10.34 (latest stable). Pin now lives in `cyrius.cyml` (`cyrius = "5.10.34"`); the standalone `.cyrius-toolchain` file was retired.
- **manifest** — `cyrius.toml` → `cyrius.cyml`. Package version is no longer hand-edited in the manifest — `version = "${file:VERSION}"` reads `VERSION` at toolchain-resolve time, so `VERSION` is the only file the release process touches.
- **lib/** — vendored stdlib stubs removed from the tree; `./lib/` is gitignored. `cyrius deps` repopulates from the version-pinned stdlib snapshot referenced in `[deps] stdlib` (matches the agnosys / yukti / patra convention). Prevents prior-version stubs from sitting in tree across toolchain bumps.
- **ci** — agnosys-parity gate set: syntax check (`cyrius check`), fmt diff-check, lint with warn-as-error, vet (include-graph audit), capacity gate, aarch64 best-effort cross-build, security-pattern scan (raw execve / shadow access / large fn-scope buffers), version-consistency gate (`VERSION` ↔ `CHANGELOG.md` ↔ `cyrius.cyml ${file:VERSION}`), required-docs check now includes `CLAUDE.md`, `docs/development/roadmap.md`, and `docs/doc-health.md`.
- **release** — accepts both `vX.Y.Z` and `X.Y.Z` tag styles; semver shape verified; SHA256SUMS published alongside source archive + per-arch binaries; pre-release flag auto-set for `0.x` tags.
- **scripts/version-bump.sh** — touches only `VERSION` now (was editing both `VERSION` and `cyrius.toml`); the manifest substitutes automatically via `${file:VERSION}`.
- **CLAUDE.md** — cleanliness gates rewritten from Rust toolchain (`cargo fmt/clippy/audit/deny/doc`) to Cyrius equivalents (`cyrius check/fmt/lint/vet/capacity`); P(-1) and Work Loop sections refreshed; version-discipline rules (VERSION is single SoT, `./lib/` never committed) added under Key Principles and DO NOT.
- **docs/development/roadmap.md** — reshaped: shipped items dated (1.1.0 itself folded in at closeout with the full modernization summary inline), post-v1.0 polish items slotted across 1.2.0 (intent parsing + translators), 1.2.1 (approval + interactive shell), 1.2.2 (zugot packaging); demand-gated systems / UX / consumer-app translator items moved to v1.3.x+.

### Added
- **docs/doc-health.md** — living doc-currency ledger (fresh / stale / archived / open-question), agnoshi-shaped tiers, initial audit covering ~26 markdown files plus the `agnsh.1` man page. Refreshed opportunistically when docs are touched (paired with each minor-cut closeout step per CLAUDE.md Work Loop §10).

### Fixed
- **release.yml** — was building `src/main.cyr → agnoshi` (the pre-port Rust entry / pre-rename binary), but `cyrius.cyml [build]` specifies `src/agnsh.cyr → agnsh`. Releases would have shipped the wrong binary name. Release workflow now builds and archives `agnsh`.
- **lint cleanup** — Cyrius 5.10.x added a 120-character line-length lint. Wrapped 49 long lines across `src/interpreter.cyr` (16), `src/translate.cyr` (32, mostly `Translation_new(...)` call sites), and `src/permissions.cyr` (1). Behavior unchanged; CI's lint gate now reports zero warnings.
- **fmt drift** — Cyrius 5.10.x formatter rules differ from 4.5.0. Re-formatted 5 files (`commands.cyr`, `permissions.cyr`, `session.cyr`, `translate.cyr`, `ui.cyr`) so the fmt diff-gate is clean.
- **CLAUDE.md Known Issues** — purged two stale entries: (1) the "ModeManager undefined variable" build-error note (the struct is defined in `src/mode.cyr:8` — the note was a leftover from a mid-port debugging session); (2) the "cc3 function/token limit" comment in `benchmarks-rust-v-cyrius.md` (cc3 is retired, the current Cyrius compiler has no such limit; the doc has been re-classified as historical in `docs/doc-health.md`).
- **ci: syntax check** — switched from per-file `cyrius check` loop to single `cyrius check src/agnsh.cyr` (entry-walk). agnoshi modules don't declare their own includes — `agnsh.cyr` stitches them — so isolated-file checking failed on cross-module references (`PermissionLevel` in `approval.cyr`, etc.). Same posture as vet / capacity / build.
- **ci: security scan** — agnosys's "writes to /bin / /sbin" heuristic was a false positive for agnoshi (which legitimately references `/bin/sudo` and uses `"/bin/"` / `"/sbin/"` prefix strings to *block* writes). Replaced with shell-shaped checks: raw `execve` syscall outside the approval pipeline, `/etc/shadow` access, stray sudo paths outside `src/security.cyr`. Buffer warn threshold lifted 4 KB → 8 KB (4 KB is PATH_MAX, expected pattern).
- **ci: shadow-lib note** — `cyrius deps` populates `./lib/` and the toolchain then notes the shadow against its version cache (informational, not an error). Silenced via `CYRIUS_NO_WARN_SHADOW_LIB=1` at job-level env so CI logs stay clean.
- **agnsh.cyr: duplicate getenv stub** — cc3-era stub at `src/agnsh.cyr:17` shadowed the real `getenv` shipped by `lib/io.cyr` on Cyrius 5.10.x, triggering a duplicate-fn linker warning. Stub removed; `ui_show_*` / `chrono_now_rfc3339` stubs remain (their real impls live in `src/ui.cyr` / `lib/chrono.cyr` which aren't pulled into this entry's include graph — slot the full-entry migration into 1.2.0 alongside the deeper-intent-parsing work).
- **agnsh.cyr: VERSION_STR** — bumped `"agnoshi 1.0.0"` → `"agnoshi 1.1.0"`; the `-v` flag was reporting the old version after the bump.

### Notes
- **Binary size**: 146 KB (1.0.0 on Cyrius 4.5.0) → 271,912 bytes (1.1.0 on Cyrius 5.10.x). Toolchain-side growth from richer stdlib + codegen, not from new agnoshi code. Still a single statically-linked ELF with no dynamic deps.
- **Cyrius 5.10.x source rule**: trailing commas in call argument lists are rejected by `cyrius build` even though `cyrius fmt` preserves them. Apply line-wraps without a trailing comma after the last argument.
- **Local-vs-CI toolchain skew**: the pin in `cyrius.cyml` is 5.10.34; local dev may run a newer 5.10.x. Verified compatible against 5.10.47.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-04-13

### Added
- **port** — full Cyrius port of the Rust codebase (27,251 → 4,042 lines, 20 modules)
- **sanitize.cyr** — shared validation module: `is_safe_arg`, `is_safe_path`, `get_command_basename`, `strip_control_chars`, `json_escape`, `build_safe_env`, `is_valid_pid`, `is_safe_branch_name`, `is_safe_commit_message`, `is_safe_username`
- **audit** — JSON-escaped audit log output (prevents log injection)
- **benchmarks** — `tests/bench_core.bcyr` with 10 benchmarks; results in `bench-history.csv` and `benchmarks-rust-v-cyrius.md`
- **tests** — `tests/test_core.tcyr` (100 assertions), `tests/test_security.tcyr` (80 assertions)
- **scripts/install.sh** — install to /usr/local/bin
- **scripts/uninstall.sh** — clean removal
- **scripts/smoke-test.sh** — 20 end-to-end tests for the binary
- **docs/agnsh.1** — man page
- **docs/audit/2026-04-13.md** — 21-finding security audit report
- **CI** — GitHub Actions workflow builds, smoke-tests, and benchmarks on every push

### Changed
- **entry point** — `src/agnsh.cyr` replaces `src/main.cyr` (minimal, works with current cc3)
- **binary name** — `agnsh` (was `agnoshi`) to match man page and prior convention
- **permissions** — `analyze_command_permission` now extracts basename before classification (prevents `/usr/bin/dd` bypass)
- **security** — check effective UID (catches setuid), sudo re-verified at escalation time
- **checkpoint** — backups moved from world-readable `/tmp` to `$HOME/.agnoshi/checkpoints` (mode 0700)
- **checkpoint** — auto-prune keeps only the most recent 100 entries (deletes old backups)
- **interpreter** — split `Interpreter_translate` 42-arm match into `translate_core` + `translate_extended` (cc3 per-function limit)
- **IntentTag** — pruned from 211 to 44 entries (downstream consumer apps deferred)

### Fixed
- **security (C1)** — command bypass via absolute/relative paths (basename extraction)
- **security (C2)** — argument injection (dangerous character validation)
- **security (C3)** — null pointer dereference in 4 translators
- **security (C4)** — JSON injection in audit logs
- **security (C5)** — 8 unhandled intent tags fell through to SAFE echo
- **security (H1)** — euid check in root detection
- **security (H2)** — environment inheritance in privilege escalation (clean env whitelist)
- **security (H3)** — checkpoint dir in world-readable /tmp
- **security (H4)** — git branch terminal escape injection
- **security (H5)** — approval UI terminal escape injection
- **security (H7)** — git commit message argument injection (leading-dash reject)
- **security (M1)** — /proc/self/environ 8KB fixed buffer (now 32KB dynamic with bounds check)
- **security (M2)** — PID validation (`kill 0` kills process group)
- **security (M3)** — rm flag parsing (`--`, combined flags, per-char scan)
- **security (M4)** — path traversal in file translators
- **security (M5)** — backslash escape handling in quote parser
- **security (M6)** — alias expansion metacharacter injection
- **security (M7)** — checkpoint failure warning before destructive ops
- **security (M8)** — /etc/passwd username validation
- **security (M9)** — sudo re-verification at escalation time

### Performance
- parse/list_files: 32.0us (Rust) → 1us (Cyrius) — **32× faster**
- parse/cd: 19us (Rust) → 1us (Cyrius) — **19× faster**
- binary size: 3.8 MB (Rust, dynlinked+debug) → 146 KB (Cyrius, static) — **−96%**
- startup: ~2-5ms (Rust, dynamic linker) → microseconds (Cyrius, static ELF)
- note: translation is 4-8× slower per call (still sub-microsecond); net pipeline 19× faster

### Removed
- **Rust implementation** — preserved in `rust-old/` for reference during port

## [0.90.0] - 2026-04-02

### Added

- **interpreter** — 10 git workflow intents: `GitCommit`, `GitDiff`, `GitBranch`, `GitStatus`, `GitLog`, `GitPush`, `GitPull`, `GitCheckout`, `GitMerge`, `GitStash` with full NL parsing, translation, and tests
- **interpreter** — 7 user/group management intents: `UserAdd`, `UserDelete`, `UserMod`, `Passwd`, `GroupAdd`, `GroupDelete`, `GroupList` with full NL parsing, translation, and tests
- **interpreter** — 7 firewall intents: `FirewallAllow`, `FirewallDeny`, `FirewallList`, `FirewallStatus`, `FirewallEnable`, `FirewallDisable`, `FirewallDeleteRule` with full NL parsing (ufw-based), translation, and tests
- **explain** — added explanations for `ufw`, `nft`, `iptables`, `ip6tables`, `groupdel`
- **security** — prompt injection defense: all external content sanitized before LLM prompts (OWASP ASI01/ASI02); strips role-override patterns, special tokens, truncates to 4KB
- **security** — command validation: LLM-generated commands validated with `shlex::split()` before presentation; rejects malformed syntax
- **security** — sandbox hardening: Landlock now protects dotfiles (`.bashrc`, `.ssh/`, `.gitconfig`) as read-only (OWASP ASI03)

### Changed
- **deps** — `agnosys` dependency temporarily switched to local path for musl static build (pending agnosys release with ioctl fix)
- **explain** — replaced 140-arm `match` statement with `LazyLock<HashMap<&'static str, &'static str>>`; eliminates per-call String allocation
- **interpreter** — extracted `cap_str()` / `cap_opt()` parse helpers; deduplicated ~155 capture-group extraction patterns across 4 parse files
- **security** — refactored `analyze_command_permission()`: extracted command lists to module-level constants (`BLOCKED_COMMANDS`, `ADMIN_COMMANDS`, `WRITE_COMMANDS`, `READ_ONLY_COMMANDS`, `SAFE_COMMANDS`); extracted `normalize_path()` and `targets_system_path()` helpers
- **session** — removed unused `_config`, `_security`, `_output` fields from `Session` struct
- **session** — added structured tracing to command execution (duration, exit code) and approval decisions
- **config** — extracted `DEFAULT_MCP_BASE_URL` constant; `DEFAULT_LLM_TIMEOUT_SECS` constant in llm module

### Fixed

- **security** — `get_username` now reads from passwd database instead of trusting `$USER` env var (was spoofable to bypass permission checks)
- **security** — JSON injection in phylax.rs scan target: switched from `format!()` to `serde_json::json!()`
- **security** — added 16 missing dangerous commands to admin list: `kill`, `killall`, `pkill`, `reboot`, `shutdown`, `poweroff`, `halt`, `iptables`, `ip6tables`, `nft`, `ufw`, `crontab`, `visudo`, `su`, `swapoff`, `swapon`, `mknod`; added `shred` to blocked list
- **security** — removed duplicate `dd` entry from blocked list
- **interpreter** — fixed `list` regex: made first group required — was matching empty strings and arbitrary input (e.g., `""`, `"htop"`, `"go to /tmp"` all incorrectly parsed as `ListFiles`)
- **interpreter** — fixed `cd` regex capture group: `caps.get(4)` → `caps.get(5)` — `cd` and `go to` now correctly parse as `ChangeDirectory`
- **interpreter** — fixed `find` regex: greedy `(.+)` → non-greedy `(.+?)` so `\s+in\s+(.+)` path group can match
- **session** — fixed pipe deadlock: replaced `child.wait()` + post-read with `child.wait_with_output()` (child filling pipe buffer could deadlock)
- **session** — `rm` checkpoint now backs up all non-flag target files (was only checkpointing the first)
- **mode** — `toggle()` now respects `allow_switching` guard (was bypassing it, allowing mode changes when disabled)
- **schema_filter** — fixed cache age off-by-one: matched categories now get age 0 (not 1) after update; moved cache update before merge so expired schemas aren't returned
- **audit** — replaced byte-offset string slicing with `chars().take(n)` to prevent panic on multi-byte UTF-8
- **completion** — fixed case-sensitivity: registered names now lowercased at insertion for correct case-insensitive matching
- **output** — `format_auto` now pretty-prints valid JSON instead of double-wrapping it in `{"output": ...}`
- **permissions** — added wildcard arm for `#[non_exhaustive]` `PermissionLevel` (future variants default to denied)
- **bench** — fixed duplicate `--all-features` flag in `bench-history.sh`
- **bench** — fixed `bench-history.sh` CSV parsing: criterion `change:` lines (containing `%` values) were captured alongside actual timing lines, corrupting CSV and crashing the markdown generator
- **security** — URL parameter injection in `phylax.rs`: severity value now percent-encoded (was raw-embedded, allowing `?severity=critical&evil=true`)
- **security** — `sanitize_url_segment()` in `package.rs` now rejects URL-special characters (`?`, `&`, `#`, `%`, `=`) in addition to path traversal sequences
- **dashboard** — fixed UTF-8 panic: byte-offset string slicing (`&s[..N]`) replaced with `chars().take(N)` for agent ID and action truncation (was crashing on multi-byte characters)

### Changed

- **mode** — `Mode` now derives `Copy` (all unit variants); removed unnecessary `.clone()` calls
- **mode** — `toggle()` now returns `Result<()>` (was `()`)
- **security** — moved `echo` out of `safe` list (was dead entry; already in `read_only` which is checked first)
- **deps** — replaced `once_cell::sync::Lazy` with `std::sync::LazyLock` (stable in Rust 1.89)
- **deps** — removed `once_cell` dependency
- **deps** — added `agnosys` git URL to `deny.toml` `allow-git`
- **api** — added `#[must_use]` to 20+ pure functions across security, permissions, commands, aliases, completion, history, output modules
- **api** — added `#[inline]` to hot-path functions: `Interpreter::parse()`, `Interpreter::translate()`, `CompletionEngine::complete()`
- **api** — added `#[must_use]` to `Interpreter::translate()` and `Interpreter::explain()`; `explain()` intentionally not `#[inline]` (17K-line match statement — inlining hurts icache)
- **security** — `rm` permission logic now distinguishes dangerous flags (`-r`, `-f`, `-rf`, `--recursive`, `--force`, `--no-preserve-root`) from safe flags (`-v`, `-i`); safe-flagged `rm` requires approval (Admin), dangerous-flagged `rm` is Blocked
- **deps** — removed unused `BSD-2-Clause` from `deny.toml` allow list
- **tests** — 1,241 unit tests (up from 1,109); 132 new tests covering git/user/firewall intents, prompt injection defense, UTF-8 truncation, URL injection, URL sanitization, rm flag classification

## [0.90.0] - 2026-04-02

### Added

- **session** — error recovery loop: when a command fails, LLM suggests a fix (shown in cyan)
- **session** — revision workflow: `Intent::Unknown` now queries LLM with context before falling back to raw shell execution
- **session** — richer LLM context: `suggest_command_with_context` sends CWD, recent history, and last exit code to LLM
- **checkpoint** — checkpoint/rollback system for destructive operations (`rm`, `mv`); `undo` builtin restores files
- **interpreter** — 12 stiva container intents: run, stop, ps, rm, pull, images, rmi, build, logs, exec, inspect, ansamblu (compose)
- **interpreter** — 7 new shell domain intents: `Chmod`, `Chown`, `Symlink`, `Archive`, `Cron`, `ServiceEnable`, `EnvVar` with full NL parsing, translation, and tests
- **interpreter** — wired up 6 previously orphaned patterns: `find`, `remove`, `install`, `du`, `kill`, `netinfo` — these NL inputs were silently falling to Unknown
- **interpreter** — 140+ command explanations (up from 12), covering file ops, process mgmt, network, archive, dev tools, and more
- **tests** — 1,096 unit tests (up from 769)
- **docs** — CLAUDE.md with development process, principles, and DO NOTs
- **ci** — GitHub Actions CI (ci.yml) and release (release.yml) workflows
- **ark** — registered as `ark install --group shell` meta-package

### Fixed

- **security** — JSON injection prevention in knowledge.rs, marketplace.rs, package.rs via `serde_json::json!()`
- **security** — URL path sanitization in marketplace.rs and package.rs
- **security** — expanded shell metacharacter filtering in misc.rs pipeline validation
- **security** — null byte validation in network target validation
- **interpreter** — fixed parser ordering: moved `list` pattern to end (was swallowing all inputs due to all-optional regex)
- **interpreter** — tightened `show_file` regex to require "content(s) of" keyword (prevented false matches)
- **interpreter** — fixed `ai_shell::` crate references to `agnoshi::` in all benchmark files
- **interpreter** — collapsed 10 nested `if` statements into `if let` chains
- **interpreter** — replaced `unwrap()` in patterns.rs and platforms.rs with proper error handling

### Changed

- **api** — added `#[non_exhaustive]` to all public enums, `#[must_use]` on pure functions, `#[inline]` on hot paths
- **api** — added `PermissionLevel` to root re-exports, crate-level documentation
- **security** — added doc comments to all `PermissionLevel` variants, `.context()` on privilege escalation
- **deps** — updated deny.toml: added `MPL-2.0`, `CDLA-Permissive-2.0`; removed unused licenses; wildcard path deps allowed
- **version** — bumped to 0.90.0 to align with AGNOS ecosystem versioning

### Performance

- intent_parsing/batch/100: 2.43ms → 1.09ms (−55%)
- intent_parsing/batch/500: 13.1ms → 5.38ms (−59%)

## [0.1.0] - 2026-04-01

### Added

- Initial extraction from `agnosticos/userland/ai-shell/`
- Natural language interpreter with 19-file module structure
- 30+ domain translators (filesystem, process, network, AGNOS, packages, marketplace, all consumer apps)
- Intent classification and pattern matching
- Security approval workflows with human oversight
- Session management and context tracking
- Fuzzy completion engine
- Command history with search
- Dashboard for system status
- Alias system
- LLM integration via hoosh
- Audit logging
- 3 criterion benchmark suites (ai_shell, system_bench, intent_parsing)
